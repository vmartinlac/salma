=======

The added value offered by this project is:

* an user interface allowing to
  * record mono or stereo video stream,
  * calibrate cameras and stereo rigs,
  * compute visual odometry trajectory,
  * display trajectory and odometry data.
* a stereo visual odometry algorithm.
* a algorithm to track calibration target.
* a code for synchronizing video stream from multiple cameras.
